### How to run JS files:

Install Node.js (if not already installed).

Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser.
Download and install Node.js from Node.js official website.
Verify installation by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

Run the Script in the Terminal

Navigate to the directory containing your JavaScript file using the cd command:

```
cd path/to/your/file
```

Run the script using Node.js:

```
node anagram.js
```

View the Output

The terminal will display the output of the function. For the provided code:

```
true
```

This indicates that "hello" and "elloh" are anagrams.

If you want to test other inputs, modify the console.log line or pass arguments interactively. Let me know if you need help setting up!
